## Data Visualization (Udacity)



• Exploratory analysis
</br>
> Looking for relationships in the data </br>
> Connect to questions about data </br>
> Visualizations don't need to be perfect </br>

• Explanatory visualizations
</br>
> Highlight insights </br>
> Surrounded by a story </br>
> Do not include unneeded information </br>

</br>

• 5 Steps in Data Analysis (and visualization)
</br>
> Extract - Clean - Explore - Analyze - Share

Extract - Obtain the data from a spreadsheet, SQL, the web, etc. </br>
Clean - Here we could use exploratory visuals. </br>
Explore - Here we use exploratory visuals. </br>
Analyze - Here we might use either exploratory or explanatory visuals. </br>
Share - Here is where explanatory visuals live.
</br>

• Bad Data Visualization </br>
> Misleading </br>
> Hiding </br>
> Distracting </br>

...to prevent that: </br>
1) Avoid: adding extra elements to the visuals that do not convey the message in your data. </br>
2) Strive for elegance and simplicity in your visuals. </br>

</br>

Data-to-ink Ratio (1983, Edward Tufte) </br>
The higher the data-to-ink ratio, the better. The formula is: </br>
> amount of ink used to describe the data </br>
> / </br>
> amount of ink used to describe everything else </br>
(Higher the better)

// Get it right in black and white // </br>
> Before adding colours to your visualization, you should determine if you need colour in the first place. </br>
> Many times black, white or greyscale will be enough to effectively convey your information. </br>
> Consider using less intense colours; natural colours or pastels. Not the colors of the rainbow, which is the default in many software applications. </br>
> Also: you can add grey value to make colours less vibrant. </br>

// Make colour selections that facilitates communication. //
> Color for communication. Use color to highlight your message and separate groups of interest. Don't add color just to have color in your visualization.
